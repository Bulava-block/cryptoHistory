               some of them you will need to forge<br>

            <h1 class="heading">how to create a forge</h1>
            <p class="h3"> Let's say  you have 2 collections of cards:<br>

                A, B, C  and X, Y, Z.<br>
                Let's say there is only 5 collections A, B, C  and 5 collections X, Y, Z.<br>
                Every card will have a number.

                That means:<br>
                A1, B1, C1<br>
                A2, B2, C2<br>
                etc....<br>

                Let's say there is a card "K" that requares "A" and "Z" in order to be forged<br>
                K=A+Z<br>

                So all you have to do is combine card "A" and card "Z" to forge card "K"<br>
                 
                But.... <br>

                Since we have 5 collections of ABC and 5 collections of XYZ the card "K" can only be forged 5 times<br>
                and there is no way to forge more.<br>

                The conditions to create a card are:<br>

                The cards that you pair together should not be have paired previously otherwise you won't forge a card<br>

                K=A1+Z1;<br>

                K=A1+Z5;<br>
                etc..<br>
                Let's say some other collector collects A1 and Z5 after you've used them already.<br>
                 Now this collector want's to do the same,<br>
                 but it will not work. <br>

            <h1 class="heading">How to destroy cards</h1>
            <p class="h3">
              
                In order to destroy a card you need to own 2 cards of the same name.<br>
                For example:<br>
                You own A1 and A3;<br>
                in this case you can destroy either A1 or A3;<br>
                by doing that you increase the value of the cards "A" because now there is fewer of them in the system<br>
                and if they ever have to be used other for some other collections <br>
                other collectors will have to deal with the ones that own "A"<br>
